# Acharya-Automated-Class-V2
Previous version was only working before they changed there websites and i decided to add some more features to the project like UI/UX, exe, Save File

This program enables you to attend classes without actually being there. 

Currently i am working on the UI and EXE file for ease of access for any user in the future.
As well as a automated polling function which teachers might enable automatically to check awareness of the student..

**STEP 1 :** Download the setup
**STEP 2 :** Install the setup
**STEP 3 :** Run the program
**STEP 4 :** Enter credentials for login
**STEP 5 :** You are good to go. Just run or shedule the program before your classes start.

**NOTE :**  The program is based on selenium so it need the approriate chrome drivers to work. if the program doesnt run replace the chromedriver in the extra file inside the installiation folder with the same version as your google chrome from this site https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads .
