# Acharya-Automated-Class-V2
Previous version was only working before they changed there websites and i decided to add some more features to the project like UI/UX, exe, Save File

This program enables you to attend classes without actually being there. 

Currently i am working on the UI and EXE file for ease of access for any user in the future.
As well as a automated polling function which teachers might enable automatically to check awareness of the student..


TODO 
1. Make UI Better
2. Make EXE file
